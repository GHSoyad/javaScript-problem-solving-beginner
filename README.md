Problem solving with JavaScript - Beginner level
#

#1 Harry’s mom gave him money (1000) and asked him to buy some oranges (1kg = 300) and apples (1kg = 400). Write a program to help Harry calculate how much money the shopkeeper will return.

#2 Write a program to calculate the average marks of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Bangla of a student. (Assume marks for each subjects)

#3 John’s teacher gave him two variables. Each variable contains a string. John’s teacher asked him to combine these two strings and print them in one line. Help John write the program. (Assume two senteces as strings)

#4 Sarah’s mother is teaching her mathematics. She gave Sarah a number and asked her what the remainder would be if she divided the number by 5. Help Sarah write the program. (Assume the number)

#5 Check the variable decralations. See if you can find the problems?
● Var price = 33
● var name - Shabana
● var boxName = ‘Cocola;
● var 88_price = 34;
● var enum = -1;
● var _$box’78 = ‘Monika’;
● var home-address = “kochu khet”;

#6 You are given an array:
var fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];
a) Find the index of ‘Banana’ and replace ‘Banana’ with ‘Mango’.
b) Remove ‘Orange’ and add ‘Watermelon’.

#7 You and your friends Tom, Jane, Peter and John got their final exam results. Your total score is 85, Tom’s total score is 66, Jane’s total score is 95, Peter’s total score is 56 and John’s total score is 40.
The grading chart is
● 80 or above A grade,
● 60 or above B grade,
● 50 or above C grade,
● 40 or above D grade,
● 39 or less => F grade.
Write a program to find your and your friends’ grades using if-else.

#8 You are given three numbers 13, 79, and 45. Write a program that will print the largest number using if-else.

#9  You are given a triangle with the sides 9, 8, 9. Write a program to check whether a triangle is Equilateral or Isosceles or not using if-else. (Equilateral => => three sides are equal, Isosceles => two sides are equal)

#10 You placed first on your final exam. You dont know the grades of your friends Aliya, Daliya, Saliya, Maliya, Liliya, Jaliya. However you know their marks Aliya got 95, Daliya got 66, Saliya got 80, Maliya got 59, Liliya got 47, and Jaliya got 77. Write a JS code to find out their grades. (Use switch statement)
Use the grading chart
● Those who got marks under 50, their grade is F,
● Those who got marks equal to or more than 50 and less than 60, their grade is D,
● Those who got marks equal to or more than 60 and less than 70, their grade is C,
● Those who got marks equal to or more than 70 and less than 80, their grade is B,
● Those who got marks equal to or more than 80 and less than 90, their grade is A,
● Those who got marks equal to or more than 90, their grade is A+.

#11 You are leaving for school in a hurry, but while crossing the road you saw the signal is red. If you try to cross the road at this time it will be dangerous. If you see the yellow signal you should slow down. and if the signal is green then you should go. Now write a code where signal will be a variable and the value can be red, yellow or green and what the output should do based on different signal.

#12 Task list for everyday:
● Unlock module at 8 pm,
● Watch the videos and practice,
● Take notes while watching videos,
● After finishing the module practice it again,
● If you dont understand something join support session.
Now use a for loop 10 times on the tasks and show output.

13# Now use a while loop 10 times on the tasks and show output. (Task list in problem 12)

14# Now solve the same problem with a reverse while loop (decremental). (Task list in problem 12)

15# Now solve the same problem with a reverse for loop (decremental). (Task list in problem 12)

16# If you have more than $80000 you will buy a macbook, if you have more than $60000 you will buy a gaming laptop, if you have more than $40000 you will buy a lenovo yoga, if you have more than more than $20000 you will buy a used laptop, else you will use phone.

17# "Aske amar mon bhalo nei" show its output 39 times.

18# How does while loop work?

19# Write a code that shows all the numbers from 58 to 98.

20# Write a code that shows all the even numbers between 412 and 456.

21# Write a code that shows all the odd numbers between 581 and 623.

22# Make an array of the things you have learned so far. Then use a for loop to show each array elements as output.

23# Make an array with the list of phone models you have used so far. Then use a while loop to show each array elements one by one as output.

24# Run a for loop from 30 to 86. The loop will break when it reaches 44.

25# Make an array of all the books you have. Now write a code that will skip all the books that cost more than $200. Only the books under $200 should be shown as output.

26# Write a function called foo() which prints “foo” and a function called bar() which prints “bar”. Call function bar() in the foo() function after printing. What will be the output? Now call the foo() to see the output.

27# Write a function called make_avg() which will take an three integers and return the average of those values.

28# Challenging: Write a function called make_avg() which will take an array of integers and the size of that array and return the average of those values.

29# Write a function called odd_even() which takes an integer value and tells whether this value is even or odd. You need to do it in 4 ways:
● Has return + Has parameter
● No return + Has parameter

30# You are in a hurry to go to your school on time. But when you are crossing the road, the traffic signal is red coloured. In this situation, if you try to cross the road, you may be in danger.If you notice a yellow coloured traffic signal, you should stop. If you notice a green coloured traffic signal, you should cross the road. So write a JS code, where there is a variable called signal. Its value can be green, yellow or red & we will get different activities as output depending on the variable. So, hurry up.

31# Write a function to show the output of multiplication table of 13.

32# Write a function that will take a name in uppercase or regular letters and will return the name in lowercase letters.

33# Write a function called fullName() which will take first part nad last part of your name as parameters. The function will then add the two parts together and return the full name. Like "hablu" and "kanto" are two input parameters and it will return "hablu kanto".

34# Write a function that will take a number as input parameter and it will return the square of the number. Like if you input parameter as 5 it will return 25.

#35 Write a function that will take hour as the input parameter and will convert it into minutes and will return the result in minutes.

#36 Write a function findLeapYear() that will take the array [2023, 2024, 2025, 2028, 2030] as the input parameter and will check if each year is a leap year. If a year is a leap year insert that year in a new array, return the new array and print the result.

#37 Write a function findOddSum() that will take the array [ 5, 7, 8, 10, 45, 30 ] as the input parameter and will return the sum of the odd numbers.

#38 Write a function called leapYear() check if the next year 2023 is leap year or not. If its a leap year it will return true else it will return false.

#39 Check if your age is odd or even with a function. If you input a number as parameter it will return true if the number is even else it will return false if the number is odd.

#40 Write a function that will take hour as the input parameter and will convert it into seconds and will return the result in seconds.

#42 Write a code to show all the odd numbers between 50 and 80.

#43 Write a function that can add 3 given numbers.

#44 Write a function that takes celsius as input parameter and returns fahrenheit as output.
