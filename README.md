Problem solving with JavaScript - Beginner level
#

#01 Harry’s mom gave him money (1000) and asked him to buy some oranges (1kg = 300) and apples (1kg = 400). Write a program to help Harry calculate how much money the shopkeeper will return.

#02 Write a program to calculate the average marks of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Bangla of a student. (Assume marks for each subjects)

#04 Sarah’s mother is teaching her mathematics. She gave Sarah a number and asked her what the remainder would be if she divided the number by 5. Help Sarah write the program. (Assume the number)

#05 Check the variable decralations. See if you can find the problems?
● Var price = 33
● var name - Shabana
● var boxName = ‘Cocola;
● var 88_price = 34;
● var enum = -1;
● var _$box’78 = ‘Monika’;
● var home-address = “kochu khet”;

#06 You are given an array:
var fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];
a) Find the index of ‘Banana’ and replace ‘Banana’ with ‘Mango’.
b) Remove ‘Orange’ and add ‘Watermelon’.

#07 You and your friends Tom, Jane, Peter and John got their final exam results. Your total score is 85, Tom’s total score is 66, Jane’s total score is 95, Peter’s total score is 56 and John’s total score is 40.
The grading chart is
● 80 or above A grade,
● 60 or above B grade,
● 50 or above C grade,
● 40 or above D grade,
● 39 or less => F grade.
Write a program to find your and your friends’ grades using if-else.

#08 You are given three numbers 13, 79, and 45. Write a program that will print the largest number using if-else.

#10 You placed first on your final exam. You dont know the grades of your friends Aliya, Daliya, Saliya, Maliya, Liliya, Jaliya. However you know their marks Aliya got 95, Daliya got 66, Saliya got 80, Maliya got 59, Liliya got 47, and Jaliya got 77. Write a JS code to find out their grades. (Use switch statement)
Use the grading chart
● Those who got marks under 50, their grade is F,
● Those who got marks equal to or more than 50 and less than 60, their grade is D,
● Those who got marks equal to or more than 60 and less than 70, their grade is C,
● Those who got marks equal to or more than 70 and less than 80, their grade is B,
● Those who got marks equal to or more than 80 and less than 90, their grade is A,
● Those who got marks equal to or more than 90, their grade is A+.

#11 You are leaving for school in a hurry, but while crossing the road you saw the signal is red. If you try to cross the road at this time it will be dangerous. If you see the yellow signal you should slow down. and if the signal is green then you should go. Now write a code where signal will be a variable and the value can be red, yellow or green and what the output should do based on different signal.

● No return + Has parameter

30# You are in a hurry to go to your school on time. But when you are crossing the road, the traffic signal is red coloured. In this situation, if you try to cross the road, you may be in danger.If you notice a yellow coloured traffic signal, you should stop. If you notice a green coloured traffic signal, you should cross the road. So write a JS code, where there is a variable called signal. Its value can be green, yellow or red & we will get different activities as output depending on the variable. So, hurry up.
