// Sarahâ€™s mother is teaching her mathematics. She gave Sarah a number and asked her what the remainder would be if she divided the number by 5. Help Sarah write the program. (Assume the number)

// Declaring the variables
var numberGiven = 119;

// Using modulus sign (%) to get the remainder and storing the result in a variable
var remainder = numberGiven % 5;
console.log("The remainder of", numberGiven, "is", remainder);
