// How does while loop work?

// The while statement creates a loop (araund a code block) that is executed while a condition is true.

// The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

// while (condition) {
//     // code block to be executed
//   }

let i = 0;    // Initialize
while (i < 5) {    // Condition
    console.log("Number is ", i);   // Output
    i++;    // Increment/Decrement
}
